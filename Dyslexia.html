        Dyslexia is a learning dis<span></span>order that i<span>n</span>volves d<span>iff</span>iculty reading <span>du</span>e to problems identifying spee<span>ch sou</span>nds and learning how they <span>re</span>late to letters and words (decoding). Also <span>ca</span>lled a reading disability, dys<span>lexi</span>a is a result of individual di<span>fferen</span>ces in areas of the brain that process lang</span>uage.

        Dy<span>sl</span>exi<span>a i</span>s not<span> d</span>ue to p<span>r</span>oblems with intell<span>ig</span>ence, hearin<span>g or vi</span>sion. Most children with dy<span>sle</span>xia can succeed in school with tutoring or<span> a</span> specialized <span>edu</span>cation program. Em<span>ot</span>ional support also plays an important role.
        
        Though the<span>re</span>'s no <span>cu</span>re for d<span>ysle</span>xia, early asses<span>s</span>ment and inter<span>vent</span>ion result in the best o<span>ut</span>come. Sometimes dys<span>le</span>xia goes und<span>iagnose</span>d for years and isn't rec<span>og</span>nized until ad<span>ult</span>hood, but <span>it's </span>never too late to seek help

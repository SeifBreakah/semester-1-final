    <p><span class="forget">Dementia is the loss of cognitive functioning — thinking,</span><span class="forget">remembering, and reasoning — to such an extent that it interferes</span><span class="forget">with a person's daily life and activities. Some people with</span><span class="forget">dementia cannot control their emotions, and their personalities may change.</span><span class="forget">Dementia ranges in severity from the mildest stage, when it is just beginning</span><span class="forget">to affect a person's functioning, to the most severe stage, when the person must depend completely</span><span class="forget">on others for basic activities of daily living, such as feeding oneself.</span> <span class="forget"> Dementia affects millions of people and is more common as people grow older </span><span class="forget">(about one-third of all people age 85 or older may have some form of dementia) but it is not</span><span class="forget">a normal part of aging. Many people live into their 90s and beyond without any signs of dementia.</span> <span class="forget">There are several different forms of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease, which is the most common.</span></p>
